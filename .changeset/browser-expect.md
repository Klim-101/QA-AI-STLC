`qa.browser_expect` checks one expected result in the page: an element visible or hidden, its text, its value, how many elements match, a checkbox state, or the page URL. It looks again until the expectation holds or the wait runs out (never longer than the environment action timeout), and registers an `expect` evidence record with what the page showed and the engine's `passed` verdict. A failed expectation is returned with the observed value rather than thrown; a malformed one is `BROWSER_EXPECT_INVALID`. A check that reads one element fails if the selector matches several, and the value of a password field is recorded as `[redacted]`. The evidence action type gains `expect` and an optional `expectation` field.
