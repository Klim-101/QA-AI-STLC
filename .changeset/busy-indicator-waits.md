Engine browser actions now wait for busy indicators to clear. `qa.browser_click` and `qa.browser_fill` wait before and after the action, and `qa.browser_navigate` waits once the page has loaded. The indicators are the selected component library's own (a loading mask) plus the project's `ui.busySelectors`, and the wait is bounded by the environment's action timeout. An indicator that never clears fails with the coded error `BROWSER_BUSY_TIMEOUT` instead of a lost click.
