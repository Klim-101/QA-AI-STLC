Add `@qa-ai-stlc/runner-api` and route `qa run --test-type api` (MCP `qa.run`) through it. Before any spec runs it loads the OpenAPI 3.x contract named by `api.source` and checks every case the spec declares: the case must be an `api` case listing the contract operations it exercises in the new optional `endpoints` field, and every one must exist in the contract, otherwise the run is rejected with `API_CASE_NOT_IN_CONTRACT` before a request is sent. The contract text is stored as `artifacts/api-contract.txt` and registered in the manifest. Contract loading and OpenAPI parsing move from the explorer into `@qa-ai-stlc/core` (`loadApiContract`), and contract URLs and discovery probes are now checked against the environment's scheme and port as well as its hostname.
