Add `@qa-ai-stlc/runner-a11y` and route `qa run --test-type a11y` (MCP `qa.run`) through it. An accessibility spec is an ordinary Playwright test that navigates and calls the generated `scanAccessibility(page, testInfo)` helper (`tests/qa/a11y-scan.ts`); the engine hands the helper the axe-core plan derived from the `a11y` configuration, registers each scan as `a11y-scan` evidence with exceptions applied, and sets the case's status from it: violations fail the case, `incomplete` results leave it `uncertain`, and a case that never scanned is rejected with `RUNNER_A11Y_NO_SCAN`. `qa run` and `qa.run` no longer answer `RUN_TEST_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED` for `a11y`.
