Component library widgets can be driven at the widget level. The new tools `qa.browser_select_option` (an option by its visible text), `qa.browser_set_date`, `qa.browser_open_popup` and `qa.browser_close_popup` find the widget wrapper from the registry's selector, act, and check the widget's resulting state before registering the action as evidence; a widget that does not take the value fails with `BROWSER_WIDGET_VALUE_MISMATCH`, a list without the option with `BROWSER_WIDGET_OPTION_NOT_FOUND`, and a popup that does not follow with `BROWSER_WIDGET_POPUP_STATE`. The Kendo UI for jQuery and Angular profiles declare which of their widgets support which actions, and the generated `tests/qa/locators.ts` gains a matching helper per widget (`<name>SelectOption`, `<name>SetDate`, `<name>OpenPopup`, `<name>ClosePopup`) so a generated spec calls it instead of a click sequence. The evidence action types gain `select-option`, `set-date`, `open-popup` and `close-popup`.
