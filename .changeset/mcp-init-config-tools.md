MCP tools `qa.init`, `qa.config_set` and `qa.config_add` let the operator run the testing-scope survey and edit `.qa/config.yaml` inside the agent host. `qa.init` takes an explicit answer for every testing type (or an explicit `undecided`), returns the absolute project root for the operator to confirm before writing anything, and refuses when `.qa/` already exists in the directory or a parent. The MCP server now resolves the project root the way `qa-start` does: the nearest directory upward that holds `.qa/`. The `init`, `config set` and `config add` operations moved from the CLI into `@qa-ai-stlc/core`; the CLI commands behave as before.
