`qa.browser_press` presses a key or chord on an element or on the page, `qa.browser_hover` moves the pointer over an element, and `qa.browser_check` sets a checkbox or radio to a state and reads it back; each registers an action evidence record. Safe mode still blocks any non-GET request a key press sets off. A lone character pressed is recorded as `[character]`, and a box the page leaves in another state is `BROWSER_CHECK_NOT_APPLIED` and registers nothing. The evidence action type gains `press`, `hover` and `check` with optional `key` and `checked` fields.
