A browser session now handles JavaScript dialogs and the pages the application opens. `alert`, `confirm` and `prompt` are dismissed by default (`qa.browser_open` takes `dialogPolicy: 'accept'` to accept them instead); each is recorded as a `dialog` evidence record and reported in `notices` in the result of the next click, key press, checkbox change, navigation or snapshot. A page a link or script opens joins the session as a tab and `qa.browser_tabs` lists the tabs and switches the active page, which retires the snapshot refs of the page it leaves. A page that opens off the domain allowlist is closed by the engine and reported as `tab-blocked`. Safe mode and the allowlist are now installed on the browser context instead of the first page, so they cover a popup's first request too.
