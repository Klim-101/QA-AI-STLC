Add `qa config show [--explain]` and MCP `qa.config_show` (ADR-011): prints the effective configuration merged from `.qa/config.yaml` and its optional local layer, the local layer's path, and every relaxation it introduces. `--explain` also names the source layer (`committed`, `local` or a schema default) of every value. An identity's `secret` is always its environment-variable name; its value is never read or shown.
