`qa.browser_snapshot` returns the page as a compact outline of its accessibility tree instead of only evidence ids. The outline is capped at 16000 characters, carries a short ref (`e1`, `e2`, ...) on every actionable node, and sits between untrusted-data markers; `truncated` and `omittedLineCount` report anything cut. The full tree is still registered as evidence. A screenshot is taken only with `screenshot: true`, so the result's `screenshot` field is now optional. `normalizeAccessibilityTree`, `truncateText`, `capArray` and the normalization limits moved from `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer` to `@qa-ai-stlc/core`.
