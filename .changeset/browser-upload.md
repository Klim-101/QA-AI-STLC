`qa.browser_upload` sets files on a file input from project-relative paths and registers an `upload` evidence record with the name, size and SHA-256 of each file, never its content or its project path. Paths are refused with `BROWSER_UPLOAD_PATH_INVALID` when they leave the project (including through a symbolic link) or sit under `.qa/` or `.git/`, a missing file is `BROWSER_UPLOAD_FILE_MISSING`, a file that matches a secret pattern is `BROWSER_UPLOAD_SECRET`, and a file over 10 MB is `BROWSER_UPLOAD_TOO_LARGE`. Each file is read once, and those exact bytes are scanned, hashed and sent; the input is read back and a page that does not hold the files is `BROWSER_UPLOAD_NOT_APPLIED`. The `FileSystem` port gains `realPath`.
