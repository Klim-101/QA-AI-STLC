# @qa-ai-stlc/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 99ddeb2: Add stability scoring to `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`: `scoreLocatorStability()` resolves one of P1-08's `LocatorCandidate`s against a live page and scores it 0..1 by verifying uniqueness now (a hard gate — a candidate resolving to anything but exactly one element scores 0), then survival across a page reload and each of a configurable set of viewport sizes (desktop/tablet/mobile by default). The original viewport is restored before returning, so scoring one element does not affect the next. `resolveCandidateLocator()` maps a candidate's strategy to the matching `AuthPage` locator method.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core`'s `AuthPage` port gained `getByRole()`, `getByTestId()`, `getByLabel()`, `getByPlaceholder()`, `getByText()`, `locator()` (each returning a `PageLocator` with `count()`), `reload()`, `setViewportSize()` and `viewportSize()`, mirroring Playwright's own `Page`/`Locator` API exactly so `playwrightBrowserLauncher` needs no glue code.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 27866c6: Add page analysis to `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`: `analyzePages()` builds a structured `PageModel` for each URL in a crawl's `RouteMap` — accessibility tree, interactive elements, forms, tables and dialogs — all length- and count-capped as untrusted, page-derived data. Page-state judgments (empty/loading/error) are deliberately not classified by the engine; only the structural signals an agent can interpret are captured.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core`'s `AuthPage` port gained `ariaSnapshotJSON()`, wrapping Playwright's own accessibility snapshot.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gained `PageModelSetSchema` (artifact kind `page-models`).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 823eb39: Add `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`, the crawler: route discovery from a start URL following only in-allowlist links, in safe mode (every non-GET request is intercepted and cancelled), producing a `RouteMap` artifact and a redactable HAR-shaped request log. Crawling can sign in first through an optional identity, reusing `authenticate()`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core`'s `AuthPage`/`AuthBrowser` ports gained `route()`, `evaluate()`, a typed `goto()` response, and `newContext(options)` to replay a captured session — needed by the crawler and available to any other consumer.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gained `RouteMapSchema` (artifact kind `route-map`), the crawler's own output artifact.
