# @qa-ai-stlc/schemas

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8c8971b: `TestCaseSchema` requires a new `feature` field (P2-20): an explicit, kebab-case, operator-chosen
  name for the tested feature a case belongs to (`FeatureIdSchema`, `packages/schemas`), never
  inferred from the case's title or a requirement id. This is a breaking schema change — an existing
  case JSON file without `feature` now fails validation and must be updated before it can be
  registered again.

  `qa cases add` / `qa.cases_add` now register a case under `artifacts/cases/<feature>/<id>.json`
  instead of the previous flat `artifacts/cases/<id>.json`, using the case's own `feature` field. `qa
validate` already lists `artifacts/cases/` recursively, so it reads a case at any folder depth; it
  still requires every case file, wherever it lives, to carry a valid `feature` — an existing flat
  case file needs `feature` added before `qa validate` can read it again.

- e968493: Fix `ManifestStore.verifyContent()`'s try-both hashing (added in the #277 fix) letting a
  CRLF-only edit to a bytes-registered artifact pass tamper detection: `hashText` normalizes CRLF to
  LF, so `hashBytes(bytes("a\nb"))` equals `hashText("a\r\nb")` whenever the original bytes are the
  UTF-8 encoding of LF-terminated text — trying a text hash as a fallback after a byte-hash mismatch
  made this collision reachable by an attacker, not just theoretical.

  `ManifestEntrySchema` now records `mode: 'text' | 'bytes'`, the hasher actually used at
  registration time. `verifyContent` checks only that recorded mode instead of guessing.

  Breaking for `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas`: `ManifestEntrySchema` gains a required `mode` field, so an
  existing `.qa/manifest.json` written before this change fails validation until every project runs
  an engine operation that re-registers its artifacts (`qa explore`, `qa scope`, etc.).

### Minor Changes

- bcad827: Adds `SpokeResultSchema`, the generic Zod-validated envelope every hub-and-spoke result flows
  through (development plan section 5.1, P2-08): a `status: 'ok' | 'error'` discriminated union
  carrying either an untyped `payload` a caller validates against its own task-specific schema, or a
  structured `SpokeError` (a stable `code`, a `message`, and optional `issues` describing exactly
  what a re-dispatch should fix). Also exports the supporting `SpokeErrorSchema` and
  `SpokeValidationIssueSchema`. Per-spoke-type payload schemas are added by the tasks that implement
  those spokes; this change adds only the shared envelope.
- 17d5441: Environments can now opt in to reaching a server behind a self-signed or internal-CA TLS
  certificate (P2-18): `environments.<name>.tlsInsecure: true` in `config.yaml` (`EnvironmentConfigSchema`,
  `packages/schemas`) bypasses certificate validation for that environment's `qa doctor` reachability
  check and every `qa explore`/`qa.browser_open` browser session, including scripted login. Off by
  default — an environment without it behaves exactly as before, rejecting an untrusted certificate.
  Enabling it prints a coded warning (`ENVIRONMENT_TLS_INSECURE`) on every run that uses it, since it
  weakens a real security guarantee.
- 1f205dd: Fix `pii`/`dynamicText` on a selector registry element being required booleans that every
  producer (crawl, static analysis, pick mode) hardcoded to `false`, with no detection logic
  anywhere in the repo. A required `false` read as "checked, and clean" — a claim nothing had
  verified (AGENTS.md 12.5, honest statuses).

  `SelectorElementSchema` now makes both fields optional; every producer omits them instead of
  asserting `false`, so a consumer can tell "not yet evaluated" from an actual check that found
  nothing. Not breaking: an existing registry with `pii: false`/`dynamicText: false` still validates
  unchanged, and no consumer branches on either field today.

- d1b29ee: Add reusable, non-secret test-data sets (P2-22): `TestDataSchema` (`packages/schemas`) is a named
  set of key/value variables, and `TestCaseSchema` gains an optional `testDataRefs` array so a case's
  steps or preconditions can reference shared values by id instead of inlining them.

  `qa test-data add` / `qa.test_data_add` validates a set and registers it under
  `artifacts/test-data/<feature>/<id>.json` (P2-20's feature-folder convention). `qa validate` now
  also rejects a case whose `testDataRefs` entry does not resolve to a registered set, reported as a
  new `unresolvedTestData` field on the validate report — both are additive, so nothing existing
  changes shape.

  Never holds credentials — those stay in identities / `QA_*` environment variables.

- 71bbbf7: Scope-aware state machine (P2-16, development plan section 2.7): the pipeline now enforces the
  testing-scope survey end to end instead of only at `qa init`.

  - `qa scope` and `qa cases add` now reject with a coded error while any testing type (`e2e`,
    `api`, `a11y`, `security`) is still `undecided` — previously only `qa init` checked this, and a
    project that later reset a type to `undecided` (or deferred the survey with `--defer-scope`)
    could scope and register cases anyway.
  - `qa cases add` also rejects a case whose own `testType` is not `in-scope`, so a case for an
    out-of-scope or undecided type is never silently registered.
  - Approving the `cases` gate now requires "one case set per in-scope type": every `in-scope` type
    needs at least one registered case, and no case may exist for a type that is not `in-scope`.
  - A later `qa config set testing.<type>` that changes a decided type reopens the `cases` gate the
    next time `qa approve`/`qa validate` runs, the same recompute-not-cache treatment `GateStateMachine`
    already gives an edited artifact's content hash (ADR-003) — `Approval` records an optional
    `testingScope` snapshot for this.
  - `qa validate`'s report gains `caseSetStatusByType`, one status (`satisfied`/`missing`/
    `not-applicable`) per case-bearing type, so an out-of-scope type's empty case set is reported as
    `not-applicable` rather than silently absent.

- f44a75b: Extend `TestCaseSchema` with two optional, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119- and ISTQB-aligned fields (P2-17):
  `preconditions` (an array of strings, state that must hold before the first step) and
  `regressionTier` (`RegressionTierSchema`, one of `smoke` < `critical-path` < `regression` <
  `extended`, ordered from narrowest to widest run via the exported `REGRESSION_TIERS` tuple).
  `qa-design-cases` (P2-09) will set both on every case it writes; existing cases without them
  remain valid, since neither field is required.

  Adds `agents/references/testing-standards.md`, a shared reference on test-design techniques, the
  `TestCaseSchema`/`DefectDraftSchema` field conventions, and the regression-tier definitions, so
  `qa-design-cases`, `qa-execute` (P3-15) and `qa-generate-tests` (P3-07) can point to it instead of
  each restating the same background.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0679258: Add the `browser.*` MCP tools, the only way an agent may drive a browser (ADR-005):
  `qa.browser_open`, `qa.browser_navigate`, `qa.browser_click`, `qa.browser_fill`,
  `qa.browser_snapshot` and `qa.browser_close`. Every one of them registers what it did as hashed,
  timestamped evidence under the session's run before it returns, so an exploratory session leaves
  a complete trail and a screenshot that the engine did not register is not a representable
  outcome. A session runs in safe mode with no opt-out — every non-GET request is aborted — and
  navigation is limited to the environment's domain allowlist, failing with
  `BROWSER_URL_NOT_ALLOWED` otherwise.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gains `BrowserSessionStore` (the live sessions, which outlive a single MCP
  call and are closed lazily after an idle timeout), `createBrowserSafeModeRouteHandler`,
  `isUrlAllowed`/`assertUrlAllowed`, the `IdGenerator` port, and one `runBrowser*` operation per
  tool. `AuthPage` gains `url()`, `title()` and `screenshot()`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gains the additive `action` evidence kind and `BrowserActionSchema`, the
  body of an action record. A filled value is recorded only by its length, never the value itself.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 554ec6d: Add test case traceability (development plan section 2.7 step 9): a case must link to at least one requirement (`TestCaseSchema.requirementIds` now requires a non-empty array), and every link is checked against the scope artifact's actual requirement ids, not just validated for shape.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gained `findUnlinkedRequirementIds`, a pure function cross-checking a case's `requirementIds` against a `Scope`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/cli` gained `qa cases add --path <path>`: validates a test case written as JSON and registers it under `artifacts/cases/<id>.json`, rejecting it up front if any linked requirement does not exist in `artifacts/scope.json`. `qa validate` now also re-checks every already-registered case's links on every run — a link broken later by editing `scope.json` is caught here, not only at `cases add` time — and its exit code is nonzero for a reopened gate or any unlinked case.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b5fbd6: Add the v0 pipeline state machine (ADR-003): `scope` then `cases`, approved in order, each gate bound to the SHA-256 of the exact artifact content it approves.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gained `PipelineStateSchema` (artifact kind `state`, `.qa/state.json`), `PhaseNameSchema` and `GateStatusSchema`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gained `GateStateMachine` (`approve()`/`validate()`), `ApprovalLedgerStore` (`.qa/artifacts/approval-ledger.json`, append-only), `PipelineStateStore` and the exported `PHASES` order. `validate()` always recomputes every gate's status from the ledger and each approved artifact's current content rather than trusting a cached field — editing an approved artifact reopens its gate the next time `approve()` or `validate()` runs, with no separate tamper check needed.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/cli` gained two commands: `qa approve <gate> --artifact <path> --approved-by <name> [--note <text>]` and `qa validate`. `qa validate` exits nonzero only when a gate that had a real approval no longer matches it (a reopened gate), not for a phase simply not yet approved.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 143e889: Add static route extraction to `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`: `analyzeStaticRoutes()` extracts client-side route declarations from source — React Router's `<Route path="...">` JSX, and Vue Router's/Angular's `path: '...'` route-config objects under a `routes` array — with file and line locations, using the same lightweight lexical scan `analyzeStaticSource()` already uses rather than a per-framework AST parser. `mergeStaticRoutes()` merges the findings into a crawler-produced `RouteMap`, resolving each path against the map's own `startUrl` origin and skipping a route the crawler already found.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas`'s `RouteDiscoveryMethodSchema` gains a `'static'` value, and `DiscoveredRouteSchema` gains an optional `sourceLocation` (the file and line a static route was found at, since there is no live navigation to point at instead).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f301cb4: Add the `qa explore` command to `@qa-ai-stlc/cli`: crawls the configured environment, synthesizes and scores locator candidates, and writes `.qa/selectors/registry.json`, `.qa/selectors/missing-test-ids.json` and the generated `tests/qa/locators.ts`, registering all three in the manifest. `--static` merges in static source analysis findings when `source.path` is configured; `--pick <url>` runs a manual pick-mode session against one page instead of crawling. `--verify` re-checks every stored, non-deprecated element's primary candidate against the live page it was found on and exits non-zero when one no longer resolves as well as it did when last recorded — the signal a stale selector (for example a renamed test ID) needs.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas`'s `SelectorElementSchema` gains an optional `pageUrl`, recorded by a `crawl`/`manual` entry so `qa explore --verify` knows which live page to re-check a stored element's candidates against.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core`'s `FileSystem` port gains `listFiles()`, listing every regular file under a directory tree recursively; `qa explore --static` uses it to discover source files to scan.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3bb0f18: Add the selector registry to `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`: `buildSelectorRegistry()` assembles a `SelectorRegistry` from a `PageModelSet`, synthesizing locator candidates for every interactive element and scoring the primary candidate's stability in a fresh live pass over the same URLs. Each element gets a stable `elementId` derived from its page, kind and best available name, so it survives a DOM reorder across two crawls. `mergeSelectorRegistry()` keeps history on re-crawl: an element the fresh crawl no longer finds is kept, not deleted, with `deprecatedAt` stamped the first time it goes missing. `diffSelectorRegistry()` reports elements added, removed or degraded (a lower stability score) between two crawls.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas`'s `SelectorElementSchema` now allows an empty `locatorCandidates` array: the `strict-no-css` synthesis policy can legitimately find no candidate at all for an element with no role, test ID, label, placeholder or text signal, and the element is still recorded (with `stabilityScore: 0`) instead of being silently dropped.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 033e9a1: Add locator synthesis to `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`: `synthesizeLocatorCandidates()` builds an ordered `LocatorCandidate[]` for an interactive element under three policies — `playwright-default` (role, testId, label, placeholder, text, CSS last), `testid-first`, and `strict-no-css` (never emits the CSS fallback). CSS candidates are always flagged `fragile: true` and built from a captured tag name and sibling position, so an element with no accessible role, label, placeholder or text still gets a candidate.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas`'s `InteractiveElement` gained the raw attributes locator synthesis needs (`role`, `label`, `placeholder`, `htmlId`, `tagName`, `nthOfType`), captured by the same page-element extraction added in P1-07 and subject to the same untrusted-data length caps.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 27866c6: Add page analysis to `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`: `analyzePages()` builds a structured `PageModel` for each URL in a crawl's `RouteMap` — accessibility tree, interactive elements, forms, tables and dialogs — all length- and count-capped as untrusted, page-derived data. Page-state judgments (empty/loading/error) are deliberately not classified by the engine; only the structural signals an agent can interpret are captured.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core`'s `AuthPage` port gained `ariaSnapshotJSON()`, wrapping Playwright's own accessibility snapshot.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gained `PageModelSetSchema` (artifact kind `page-models`).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 823eb39: Add `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`, the crawler: route discovery from a start URL following only in-allowlist links, in safe mode (every non-GET request is intercepted and cancelled), producing a `RouteMap` artifact and a redactable HAR-shaped request log. Crawling can sign in first through an optional identity, reusing `authenticate()`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core`'s `AuthPage`/`AuthBrowser` ports gained `route()`, `evaluate()`, a typed `goto()` response, and `newContext(options)` to replay a captured session — needed by the crawler and available to any other consumer.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gained `RouteMapSchema` (artifact kind `route-map`), the crawler's own output artifact.
