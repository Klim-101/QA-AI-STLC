# @qa-ai-stlc/schemas

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 823eb39: Add `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`, the crawler: route discovery from a start URL following only in-allowlist links, in safe mode (every non-GET request is intercepted and cancelled), producing a `RouteMap` artifact and a redactable HAR-shaped request log. Crawling can sign in first through an optional identity, reusing `authenticate()`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core`'s `AuthPage`/`AuthBrowser` ports gained `route()`, `evaluate()`, a typed `goto()` response, and `newContext(options)` to replay a captured session — needed by the crawler and available to any other consumer.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gained `RouteMapSchema` (artifact kind `route-map`), the crawler's own output artifact.
