# @qa-ai-stlc/mcp-server

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 4da23d6: Add `qa config show [--explain]` and MCP `qa.config_show` (ADR-011): prints the effective configuration merged from `.qa/config.yaml` and its optional local layer, the local layer's path, and every relaxation it introduces. `--explain` also names the source layer (`committed`, `local` or a schema default) of every value. An identity's `secret` is always its environment-variable name; its value is never read or shown.
- 08972c0: `qa init` writes a commented `.qa/config.local.yaml.example` showing the optional local configuration layer's syntax (ADR-011). `qa doctor` / `qa.doctor` now report every relaxation the local layer introduces (a widened allowlist entry or `tlsInsecure: true`), the same way `qa config show` / `qa.config_show` already do — `DoctorReport` gains a `relaxations` field. README and CONTRIBUTING describe the configuration layers.
- a9488cb: `qa explore` / `qa.explore` now derives a discovered API surface from the crawl's own traffic and
  writes it to `.qa/selectors/endpoints.json`, merging with anything already stored there: every
  request is redacted, then collapsed onto a templated path (`/tasks/8213`, `/tasks/t-1` →
  `/tasks/{id}`) with a capped sample of the raw paths it was collapsed from. `qa.explore`'s result
  gains `endpointsPath` and `endpointCount`. `ApiEndpointSchema` (`@qa-ai-stlc/schemas`) gains an
  optional `examples` field to hold that sample.

### Patch Changes

- 1e2ab70: Move six project-specific engine constants into config (P6-23), each defaulting to its former hardcoded value so behavior does not change without config:

  - `selectors.stabilityViewports` — the viewports a locator candidate is scored at (was: desktop/tablet/mobile, unconditionally).
  - `selectors.defaultLoginSelectors` — the generic login-form selectors used when an identity's own `selectors` names none.
  - `selectors.extraStableAttributes` — attributes, beyond `testIdAttribute`, synthesized as an extra CSS candidate when an element carries one.
  - `selectors.generatedIdPatterns` — regular expressions an `id` is checked against before it is used as a CSS fallback candidate, so a framework-generated id (React's `useId`, a CSS-module hash) is never picked.
  - `environments.<name>.navigationTimeoutMs` / `actionTimeoutMs` — Playwright's navigation and action timeouts for `qa.browser_navigate`/`_click`/`_fill`, per ADR-011 a field of the environment rather than a generic overrides block.
  - `evidence.httpBodyPreviewMaxLength` — the cap on a stored HTTP response-body preview (`qa.http_execute`), was a hardcoded 4000.

  `navigationTimeoutMs`/`actionTimeoutMs` apply to the interactive `qa.browser_*` session only; explorer's own crawl, analysis and registry-build navigation, and scripted login, are unchanged and still use Playwright's default. `extraStableAttributes` is not available during manual pick mode, which has no live DOM read for an arbitrary attribute.

- 21e7319: `qa.generation_register` no longer trusts a verification outcome supplied by the caller. `qa.generation_verify` now records every outcome as an engine-written, manifest-registered verification record under `.qa/verifications/` and returns its `verificationId`; `qa.generation_register` takes the `spec` and that `verificationId` instead of `result` and `contentSha256`. Registration is rejected with a coded error when no such record exists, the record was edited, it did not end `verified`, it was already used, or the spec's test case, file path or content differ from what was verified. Verification also requires the test case to be registered and unchanged. `qa init` adds `/verifications/` to `.qa/.gitignore`.
- 84ed459: `qa.http_execute` no longer accepts a `tlsInsecure` input: certificate validation now follows the
  resolved environment's `tlsInsecure` in `config.yaml`, the same as `qa.browser_open`. Previously a
  caller could disable validation for any call to an allowlisted host, and an environment configured
  with `tlsInsecure: true` was not honored for HTTP calls unless the caller repeated it. A warning is
  logged when the environment disables validation. `runHttpExecute`'s `tlsInsecure` option is removed.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 97a57f7: `qa-generate-tests`'s generation-contract and verification-loop engine support (P3-06/P3-07) is now
  reachable through MCP, not only as internal `@qa-ai-stlc/core` library functions an agent has no way
  to call: new `qa.generation_spoke_input` (assembles a spoke task's input from a registered case, a
  registry slice and the locator module's real `GENERATOR_VERSION` stamp), `qa.generation_verify`
  (typechecks and executes a candidate spec once, against a scratch copy, cross-checking coverage
  against the case's own canonical steps), `qa.generation_register` (writes and registers only a
  `'verified'` outcome, content-hash bound), and `qa.generation_manual_regions_extract`/`_apply`
  (deterministic `// qa:manual` region splicing, so hand-written additions survive regeneration). New
  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` operation `runBuildGenerationSpokeInput`. Proven end to end against the demo app
  in CI, with no model call, standing in for what a real spoke would produce.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 535e2e9: Adds `qa link <spec> <requirement-id> --feature <name>` / `qa.link`: folds an already-existing,
  hand-written Playwright spec into the requirement → case → result → evidence traceability matrix
  without running it through generation. Reuses the spec's own `testCaseId` annotation when present,
  so a later `qa run` still attributes its result to the same case.

### Patch Changes

- 6d5c9da: Fixes `runRegisterCaseResult` / `qa.case_result_register` accepting a fabricated result: it now
  rejects a `testCaseId` that does not resolve to a registered test case, an `evidenceIds` entry that
  was not actually registered under the given `runId`, and a `passed` result with zero evidence.
  Previously none of these were checked at registration time, so a caller could register a permanent,
  manifest-backed "passed" result for a test case that does not exist, backed by no real evidence.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d1c700a: Exposes P3-14's interactive case execution operations over MCP, so an agent host can actually
  drive them (they previously existed only in `@qa-ai-stlc/core`, unreachable from any host):

  - `qa.browser_open` gains the `executionMode` option (ADR-0009), previously core-only.
  - New tools: `qa.http_execute` (a real HTTP call for the `api` test type), `qa.browser_accessibility_scan`
    (a real axe-core scan for `a11y`), `qa.registry_execute_register` (promotes an ad hoc element pick
    into the selector registry as `source: "execute"`), and `qa.case_result_register` (ties an
    execution's evidence together into a registered run result; the caller supplies the pass/fail
    verdict, never the engine).

  Backs the new `qa-execute` skill (P3-15, `agents/skills/qa-execute/`), which drives these tools to
  prove an approved test case actually works before any code is generated for it.

- 72ebb8e: Add `qa-generate-tests` (P3-07): the skill that codifies a proven `qa-execute` session into a
  deterministic Playwright/API spec, plus the engine support it needs.

  `qa.browser_click`/`qa.browser_fill`/`qa.browser_navigate`/`qa.http_execute` accept an optional
  `stepId` (`'step-<N>'`, `N` the case step's 1-based position), carried inside the evidence content
  itself (`BrowserActionSchema`, new `HttpRequestRecordSchema`) rather than only on the `Evidence`
  wrapper, which is never persisted on its own. New core operation `findLatestProvenSession` (and its
  MCP wrapper `qa.generation_proven_session`) recovers a case's most recently proven session by
  reading its latest passing `RunResult` and grouping the evidence it points to by `stepId` — no
  separate session-log artifact. `GenerationSpokeInput` gains an optional `provenSession` field, so
  `isGeneratedTestSpecStale` (P3-04) picks up a re-executed `qa-execute` session as drift for free.

  `agents/skills/qa-execute` documents the `stepId` convention for every step-performing call;
  `agents/skills/qa-generate-tests` is new.

- 9380d0d: Add `qa run` / MCP `qa.run` (P3-04): runs a spec set through the `Runner` for its test type (only
  `e2e`, via `@qa-ai-stlc/runner-playwright`, has one so far) and persists every `RunResult` plus a
  new `RunRecordSchema` summary under `.qa/runs/<run-id>/results/` and `.qa/runs/<run-id>/run.json`.
  This is a new, per-invocation layout distinct from `qa.case_result_register`'s per-case one
  (`.qa/runs/<test-case-id>/`, P3-14): a run can cover many results from one spec set, a case-result
  registration covers exactly one ad hoc interactive check. `--environment <name>` resolves the
  `baseUrl` from `config.yaml`, the same domain-allowlist-aware resolution every other environment-
  aware command already uses.
- 1ff0e16: Add `qa report` / MCP `qa.report` (P3-08, ADR-002): renders a run summary and the requirement →
  case → result → evidence traceability matrix as Markdown or HTML, from the canonical JSON already
  recorded under `.qa/` — no hand-written report path exists. `buildTraceabilityMatrix`
  (`@qa-ai-stlc/core`) joins every requirement in `scope.json` against every case that links to it
  and each case's most recent run result across every run ever recorded, not just the one being
  reported on. Defaults to the most recently started run and Markdown format;
  `--run <run-id>`/`runId` and `--format markdown|html`/`format` select otherwise. Two new artifact
  kinds (`run-summary`, `traceability-matrix`) join the existing Markdown renderer registry, and a
  new HTML renderer registry mirrors it — the framework's first HTML output.
- 1775c76: Add `qa validate --run` / MCP `qa.validate` with `checkRuns: true` (P3-09): an opt-in sweep of
  every recorded `RunResult` — from `qa run` or from interactive case execution alike — for a
  fabricated evidence link (an `evidenceIds` entry with no matching registered evidence file,
  excluding a quarantined item's own receipt) and for a `failed` result with no registered evidence
  at all. Independent of `runTestRun`'s own write-time `RUN_RESULT_MISSING_EVIDENCE` check, this
  catches the same gap in results written through any path, including `qa.case_result_register`,
  which accepts a caller-supplied `evidenceIds` with no such check. Also fixes a real bug found
  while building this: `buildTraceabilityMatrix` (P3-08) only scanned `qa run`'s own
  `runs/<run-id>/results/` layout, silently missing every result interactive case execution wrote
  under its own flat `runs/<test-case-id>/` layout — both now share a new `listRunResultPaths`
  helper.

### Patch Changes

- e0603c1: Fixes `qa.http_execute` (#364): it made a real HTTP call to any URL it was given, with no check
  against the environment's configured domain allowlist — the only `qa.browser_*`-adjacent tool that
  didn't. `runHttpExecute` now resolves the environment (a new optional `environment` option, same
  lookup `qa.browser_open` already uses) and rejects a URL off its allowlist with
  `BROWSER_URL_NOT_ALLOWED` before making any request. This restricts which host can be called, never
  which method: a real POST/PUT/DELETE against an allowed host still works, exactly as `api`
  test-type execution requires.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 47ce6c6: Reusable JSON-to-Markdown artifact renderer, starting with test cases (P2-25, ADR-002): a real
  test case can now be rendered as a numbered, presentable Markdown document — preconditions, steps,
  expected result and case metadata (feature, requirement links, regression tier, status) — instead
  of only being visible as raw JSON.

  - `qa cases render <id>` (CLI) and `qa.cases_render` (MCP) find the registered test case with the
    given id under `artifacts/cases/**` and render it to Markdown.
  - The renderer lives behind a per-artifact-kind registry in `packages/core`, structured so a second
    artifact kind (`DefectDraftSchema`/RCA rendering, Phase 4+) can register its own Markdown
    template later without modifying the test-case renderer's code.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 574705e: Add the engine/plugin version handshake (P2-12, ADR-007): the generated Claude Code plugin's
  `.mcp.json` now pins the engine version it expects into `QA_EXPECTED_ENGINE_VERSION`. At start,
  the MCP server compares that against its own version and, on a mismatch, exits with a coded
  `ENGINE_VERSION_MISMATCH` error and a remediation instead of silently running a different engine
  version than the plugin was generated against. A server started without that variable set (for
  example directly from the CLI during development) is unaffected.
- d1b29ee: Add reusable, non-secret test-data sets (P2-22): `TestDataSchema` (`packages/schemas`) is a named
  set of key/value variables, and `TestCaseSchema` gains an optional `testDataRefs` array so a case's
  steps or preconditions can reference shared values by id instead of inlining them.

  `qa test-data add` / `qa.test_data_add` validates a set and registers it under
  `artifacts/test-data/<feature>/<id>.json` (P2-20's feature-folder convention). `qa validate` now
  also rejects a case whose `testDataRefs` entry does not resolve to a registered set, reported as a
  new `unresolvedTestData` field on the validate report — both are additive, so nothing existing
  changes shape.

  Never holds credentials — those stay in identities / `QA_*` environment variables.

### Patch Changes

- adaa974: Fix `qa validate`/`qa.validate` reporting every binary evidence artifact (screenshots, traces,
  video) as tampered, even freshly registered and untouched. `EvidenceStore` hashes binary content
  byte-for-byte (`hashBytes`); the tamper check re-read every manifest-registered path through a
  lossy UTF-8 text decode regardless of that, so a re-hash could never match.

  `ManifestStore` gains `verifyContent(relativePath, rawBytes)`: since the manifest does not record
  which hasher an entry used, it checks raw bytes against both a binary hash and a text hash of
  their UTF-8 decoding, which is strictly more correct than assuming one encoding. The `FileSystem`
  port gains a required `readBytes(absolutePath)` method (breaking for a custom implementation) so
  the tamper check can read a file without assuming its encoding ahead of time.

- e288603: Fix `qa approve`/`qa.approve` accepting any existing file as a gate's artifact, and the approval
  ledger being unprotected against a hand-edit — together these let a gate approval be forged with
  nothing detecting it: editing an artifact, recomputing its hash, and writing that hash into the
  corresponding ledger entry used to pass `qa validate` as a genuinely approved gate.

  `GateStateMachine.approve()` now requires the artifact to be manifest-registered — the content the
  engine itself last wrote to that path — throwing the existing `ARTIFACT_UNREGISTERED` /
  `ARTIFACT_HASH_MISMATCH` coded errors instead of silently approving. `ApprovalLedgerStore` now
  registers `artifacts/approval-ledger.json` in the manifest on every append, so a hand-edit to the
  ledger itself is caught by `qa validate`'s tamper check the same as any other artifact.

  Breaking for `@qa-ai-stlc/core`: `ApprovalLedgerStoreOptions` and `GateStateMachineOptions` both
  gain a required `manifest: ManifestStore` field.

- e968493: Fix `ManifestStore.verifyContent()`'s try-both hashing (added in the #277 fix) letting a
  CRLF-only edit to a bytes-registered artifact pass tamper detection: `hashText` normalizes CRLF to
  LF, so `hashBytes(bytes("a\nb"))` equals `hashText("a\r\nb")` whenever the original bytes are the
  UTF-8 encoding of LF-terminated text — trying a text hash as a fallback after a byte-hash mismatch
  made this collision reachable by an attacker, not just theoretical.

  `ManifestEntrySchema` now records `mode: 'text' | 'bytes'`, the hasher actually used at
  registration time. `verifyContent` checks only that recorded mode instead of guessing.

  Breaking for `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas`: `ManifestEntrySchema` gains a required `mode` field, so an
  existing `.qa/manifest.json` written before this change fails validation until every project runs
  an engine operation that re-registers its artifacts (`qa explore`, `qa scope`, etc.).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e329ac: `.qa/` integrity (P2-07): `qa scope` and `qa cases add` (and their MCP counterparts) now verify
  `artifacts/scope.json` against `manifest.json` before trusting it as a merge or link-check base,
  so a hand-edited scope artifact is rejected with `ARTIFACT_HASH_MISMATCH` (or `ARTIFACT_UNREGISTERED`
  for a file that was never registered through the engine) on the very next mutation, instead of being
  silently built on. `qa validate` / `qa.validate` gains a `tamperedArtifacts` field that re-hashes
  every path `manifest.json` has ever registered and reports any that are missing or no longer match —
  catching tampering on artifacts nothing has mutated since, not only the ones a fresh `scope`/`cases add`
  call happens to touch. `qa validate` now exits with a failure code and prints a "tampered artifact(s)"
  section whenever `tamperedArtifacts` is non-empty.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` also fixes a latent bug where `scope.json` and case files were hashed into the
  manifest from a compact `JSON.stringify` while the file on disk was written in the canonical
  two-space, trailing-newline form (`toCanonicalJson`) — the two never matched, which would have made
  turning on manifest verification reject every legitimately engine-written artifact. Both paths now
  hash and write the exact same bytes. `ManifestStore` gains `readVerified`, a schema-validated read
  that throws instead of returning content that failed its hash check.

  - @qa-ai-stlc/core@0.11.0
  - @qa-ai-stlc/explorer@0.7.2

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0679258: Add the `browser.*` MCP tools, the only way an agent may drive a browser (ADR-005):
  `qa.browser_open`, `qa.browser_navigate`, `qa.browser_click`, `qa.browser_fill`,
  `qa.browser_snapshot` and `qa.browser_close`. Every one of them registers what it did as hashed,
  timestamped evidence under the session's run before it returns, so an exploratory session leaves
  a complete trail and a screenshot that the engine did not register is not a representable
  outcome. A session runs in safe mode with no opt-out — every non-GET request is aborted — and
  navigation is limited to the environment's domain allowlist, failing with
  `BROWSER_URL_NOT_ALLOWED` otherwise.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gains `BrowserSessionStore` (the live sessions, which outlive a single MCP
  call and are closed lazily after an idle timeout), `createBrowserSafeModeRouteHandler`,
  `isUrlAllowed`/`assertUrlAllowed`, the `IdGenerator` port, and one `runBrowser*` operation per
  tool. `AuthPage` gains `url()`, `title()` and `screenshot()`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gains the additive `action` evidence kind and `BrowserActionSchema`, the
  body of an action record. A filled value is recorded only by its length, never the value itself.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 65d8538: Add MCP tools for every engine operation the CLI already exposes: `qa.doctor`, `qa.explore`,
  `qa.scope`, `qa.cases_add`, `qa.approve` and `qa.validate`. Each tool calls the exact same
  underlying operation its CLI command calls — `runDoctor`, `runScope`, `runCasesAdd`, `runApprove`
  and `runValidate` moved from `@qa-ai-stlc/cli` into `@qa-ai-stlc/core` as reusable, `EngineContext`-driven
  functions, and `runExplore`'s crawl/static-analysis/`--verify` logic moved into `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`
  for the same reason — so the CLI and the MCP server share one implementation instead of two. `qa
explore`'s manual pick-mode capture (`--pick <url>`) stays CLI-only: it opens a headed browser for
  a human to click through, which an agent cannot drive over MCP's stdio transport. `report` has no
  CLI command yet, so it has no MCP tool yet either.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gains a public `EngineContext` interface (`CommandContext` minus the CLI's own
  `io`/`json` concerns) that both the CLI and the MCP server build their own adapters into.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b218ce9: Add `@qa-ai-stlc/mcp-server`, the local stdio MCP server: `qa-mcp-server` starts it. `ToolDefinition` pairs a Zod input and output schema with a handler that returns a value matching the output schema or throws — a `QaError` for an expected failure, anything else for a bug. `registerTool` turns a thrown error into a structured `CallToolResult` carrying a stable `code` and, when there is one, a `remediation`, never a raw stack trace; invalid tool input is rejected automatically by the registered Zod schema before the handler runs. Ships with one built-in tool, `qa.ping`, a health check. Calls no model itself.
