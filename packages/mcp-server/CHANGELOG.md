# @qa-ai-stlc/mcp-server

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e329ac: `.qa/` integrity (P2-07): `qa scope` and `qa cases add` (and their MCP counterparts) now verify
  `artifacts/scope.json` against `manifest.json` before trusting it as a merge or link-check base,
  so a hand-edited scope artifact is rejected with `ARTIFACT_HASH_MISMATCH` (or `ARTIFACT_UNREGISTERED`
  for a file that was never registered through the engine) on the very next mutation, instead of being
  silently built on. `qa validate` / `qa.validate` gains a `tamperedArtifacts` field that re-hashes
  every path `manifest.json` has ever registered and reports any that are missing or no longer match —
  catching tampering on artifacts nothing has mutated since, not only the ones a fresh `scope`/`cases add`
  call happens to touch. `qa validate` now exits with a failure code and prints a "tampered artifact(s)"
  section whenever `tamperedArtifacts` is non-empty.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` also fixes a latent bug where `scope.json` and case files were hashed into the
  manifest from a compact `JSON.stringify` while the file on disk was written in the canonical
  two-space, trailing-newline form (`toCanonicalJson`) — the two never matched, which would have made
  turning on manifest verification reject every legitimately engine-written artifact. Both paths now
  hash and write the exact same bytes. `ManifestStore` gains `readVerified`, a schema-validated read
  that throws instead of returning content that failed its hash check.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0e329ac]
  - @qa-ai-stlc/core@0.11.0
  - @qa-ai-stlc/explorer@0.7.2

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0679258: Add the `browser.*` MCP tools, the only way an agent may drive a browser (ADR-005):
  `qa.browser_open`, `qa.browser_navigate`, `qa.browser_click`, `qa.browser_fill`,
  `qa.browser_snapshot` and `qa.browser_close`. Every one of them registers what it did as hashed,
  timestamped evidence under the session's run before it returns, so an exploratory session leaves
  a complete trail and a screenshot that the engine did not register is not a representable
  outcome. A session runs in safe mode with no opt-out — every non-GET request is aborted — and
  navigation is limited to the environment's domain allowlist, failing with
  `BROWSER_URL_NOT_ALLOWED` otherwise.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gains `BrowserSessionStore` (the live sessions, which outlive a single MCP
  call and are closed lazily after an idle timeout), `createBrowserSafeModeRouteHandler`,
  `isUrlAllowed`/`assertUrlAllowed`, the `IdGenerator` port, and one `runBrowser*` operation per
  tool. `AuthPage` gains `url()`, `title()` and `screenshot()`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gains the additive `action` evidence kind and `BrowserActionSchema`, the
  body of an action record. A filled value is recorded only by its length, never the value itself.

### Patch Changes

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 65d8538: Add MCP tools for every engine operation the CLI already exposes: `qa.doctor`, `qa.explore`,
  `qa.scope`, `qa.cases_add`, `qa.approve` and `qa.validate`. Each tool calls the exact same
  underlying operation its CLI command calls — `runDoctor`, `runScope`, `runCasesAdd`, `runApprove`
  and `runValidate` moved from `@qa-ai-stlc/cli` into `@qa-ai-stlc/core` as reusable, `EngineContext`-driven
  functions, and `runExplore`'s crawl/static-analysis/`--verify` logic moved into `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`
  for the same reason — so the CLI and the MCP server share one implementation instead of two. `qa
explore`'s manual pick-mode capture (`--pick <url>`) stays CLI-only: it opens a headed browser for
  a human to click through, which an agent cannot drive over MCP's stdio transport. `report` has no
  CLI command yet, so it has no MCP tool yet either.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gains a public `EngineContext` interface (`CommandContext` minus the CLI's own
  `io`/`json` concerns) that both the CLI and the MCP server build their own adapters into.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b218ce9: Add `@qa-ai-stlc/mcp-server`, the local stdio MCP server: `qa-mcp-server` starts it. `ToolDefinition` pairs a Zod input and output schema with a handler that returns a value matching the output schema or throws — a `QaError` for an expected failure, anything else for a bug. `registerTool` turns a thrown error into a structured `CallToolResult` carrying a stable `code` and, when there is one, a `remediation`, never a raw stack trace; invalid tool input is rejected automatically by the registered Zod schema before the handler runs. Ships with one built-in tool, `qa.ping`, a health check. Calls no model itself.
