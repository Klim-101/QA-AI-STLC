# @qa-ai-stlc/mcp-server

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 47ce6c6: Reusable JSON-to-Markdown artifact renderer, starting with test cases (P2-25, ADR-002): a real
  test case can now be rendered as a numbered, presentable Markdown document — preconditions, steps,
  expected result and case metadata (feature, requirement links, regression tier, status) — instead
  of only being visible as raw JSON.

  - `qa cases render <id>` (CLI) and `qa.cases_render` (MCP) find the registered test case with the
    given id under `artifacts/cases/**` and render it to Markdown.
  - The renderer lives behind a per-artifact-kind registry in `packages/core`, structured so a second
    artifact kind (`DefectDraftSchema`/RCA rendering, Phase 4+) can register its own Markdown
    template later without modifying the test-case renderer's code.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 574705e: Add the engine/plugin version handshake (P2-12, ADR-007): the generated Claude Code plugin's
  `.mcp.json` now pins the engine version it expects into `QA_EXPECTED_ENGINE_VERSION`. At start,
  the MCP server compares that against its own version and, on a mismatch, exits with a coded
  `ENGINE_VERSION_MISMATCH` error and a remediation instead of silently running a different engine
  version than the plugin was generated against. A server started without that variable set (for
  example directly from the CLI during development) is unaffected.
- d1b29ee: Add reusable, non-secret test-data sets (P2-22): `TestDataSchema` (`packages/schemas`) is a named
  set of key/value variables, and `TestCaseSchema` gains an optional `testDataRefs` array so a case's
  steps or preconditions can reference shared values by id instead of inlining them.

  `qa test-data add` / `qa.test_data_add` validates a set and registers it under
  `artifacts/test-data/<feature>/<id>.json` (P2-20's feature-folder convention). `qa validate` now
  also rejects a case whose `testDataRefs` entry does not resolve to a registered set, reported as a
  new `unresolvedTestData` field on the validate report — both are additive, so nothing existing
  changes shape.

  Never holds credentials — those stay in identities / `QA_*` environment variables.

### Patch Changes

- adaa974: Fix `qa validate`/`qa.validate` reporting every binary evidence artifact (screenshots, traces,
  video) as tampered, even freshly registered and untouched. `EvidenceStore` hashes binary content
  byte-for-byte (`hashBytes`); the tamper check re-read every manifest-registered path through a
  lossy UTF-8 text decode regardless of that, so a re-hash could never match.

  `ManifestStore` gains `verifyContent(relativePath, rawBytes)`: since the manifest does not record
  which hasher an entry used, it checks raw bytes against both a binary hash and a text hash of
  their UTF-8 decoding, which is strictly more correct than assuming one encoding. The `FileSystem`
  port gains a required `readBytes(absolutePath)` method (breaking for a custom implementation) so
  the tamper check can read a file without assuming its encoding ahead of time.

- e288603: Fix `qa approve`/`qa.approve` accepting any existing file as a gate's artifact, and the approval
  ledger being unprotected against a hand-edit — together these let a gate approval be forged with
  nothing detecting it: editing an artifact, recomputing its hash, and writing that hash into the
  corresponding ledger entry used to pass `qa validate` as a genuinely approved gate.

  `GateStateMachine.approve()` now requires the artifact to be manifest-registered — the content the
  engine itself last wrote to that path — throwing the existing `ARTIFACT_UNREGISTERED` /
  `ARTIFACT_HASH_MISMATCH` coded errors instead of silently approving. `ApprovalLedgerStore` now
  registers `artifacts/approval-ledger.json` in the manifest on every append, so a hand-edit to the
  ledger itself is caught by `qa validate`'s tamper check the same as any other artifact.

  Breaking for `@qa-ai-stlc/core`: `ApprovalLedgerStoreOptions` and `GateStateMachineOptions` both
  gain a required `manifest: ManifestStore` field.

- e968493: Fix `ManifestStore.verifyContent()`'s try-both hashing (added in the #277 fix) letting a
  CRLF-only edit to a bytes-registered artifact pass tamper detection: `hashText` normalizes CRLF to
  LF, so `hashBytes(bytes("a\nb"))` equals `hashText("a\r\nb")` whenever the original bytes are the
  UTF-8 encoding of LF-terminated text — trying a text hash as a fallback after a byte-hash mismatch
  made this collision reachable by an attacker, not just theoretical.

  `ManifestEntrySchema` now records `mode: 'text' | 'bytes'`, the hasher actually used at
  registration time. `verifyContent` checks only that recorded mode instead of guessing.

  Breaking for `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas`: `ManifestEntrySchema` gains a required `mode` field, so an
  existing `.qa/manifest.json` written before this change fails validation until every project runs
  an engine operation that re-registers its artifacts (`qa explore`, `qa scope`, etc.).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e329ac: `.qa/` integrity (P2-07): `qa scope` and `qa cases add` (and their MCP counterparts) now verify
  `artifacts/scope.json` against `manifest.json` before trusting it as a merge or link-check base,
  so a hand-edited scope artifact is rejected with `ARTIFACT_HASH_MISMATCH` (or `ARTIFACT_UNREGISTERED`
  for a file that was never registered through the engine) on the very next mutation, instead of being
  silently built on. `qa validate` / `qa.validate` gains a `tamperedArtifacts` field that re-hashes
  every path `manifest.json` has ever registered and reports any that are missing or no longer match —
  catching tampering on artifacts nothing has mutated since, not only the ones a fresh `scope`/`cases add`
  call happens to touch. `qa validate` now exits with a failure code and prints a "tampered artifact(s)"
  section whenever `tamperedArtifacts` is non-empty.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` also fixes a latent bug where `scope.json` and case files were hashed into the
  manifest from a compact `JSON.stringify` while the file on disk was written in the canonical
  two-space, trailing-newline form (`toCanonicalJson`) — the two never matched, which would have made
  turning on manifest verification reject every legitimately engine-written artifact. Both paths now
  hash and write the exact same bytes. `ManifestStore` gains `readVerified`, a schema-validated read
  that throws instead of returning content that failed its hash check.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0679258: Add the `browser.*` MCP tools, the only way an agent may drive a browser (ADR-005):
  `qa.browser_open`, `qa.browser_navigate`, `qa.browser_click`, `qa.browser_fill`,
  `qa.browser_snapshot` and `qa.browser_close`. Every one of them registers what it did as hashed,
  timestamped evidence under the session's run before it returns, so an exploratory session leaves
  a complete trail and a screenshot that the engine did not register is not a representable
  outcome. A session runs in safe mode with no opt-out — every non-GET request is aborted — and
  navigation is limited to the environment's domain allowlist, failing with
  `BROWSER_URL_NOT_ALLOWED` otherwise.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gains `BrowserSessionStore` (the live sessions, which outlive a single MCP
  call and are closed lazily after an idle timeout), `createBrowserSafeModeRouteHandler`,
  `isUrlAllowed`/`assertUrlAllowed`, the `IdGenerator` port, and one `runBrowser*` operation per
  tool. `AuthPage` gains `url()`, `title()` and `screenshot()`.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/schemas` gains the additive `action` evidence kind and `BrowserActionSchema`, the
  body of an action record. A filled value is recorded only by its length, never the value itself.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 65d8538: Add MCP tools for every engine operation the CLI already exposes: `qa.doctor`, `qa.explore`,
  `qa.scope`, `qa.cases_add`, `qa.approve` and `qa.validate`. Each tool calls the exact same
  underlying operation its CLI command calls — `runDoctor`, `runScope`, `runCasesAdd`, `runApprove`
  and `runValidate` moved from `@qa-ai-stlc/cli` into `@qa-ai-stlc/core` as reusable, `EngineContext`-driven
  functions, and `runExplore`'s crawl/static-analysis/`--verify` logic moved into `@qa-ai-stlc/explorer`
  for the same reason — so the CLI and the MCP server share one implementation instead of two. `qa
explore`'s manual pick-mode capture (`--pick <url>`) stays CLI-only: it opens a headed browser for
  a human to click through, which an agent cannot drive over MCP's stdio transport. `report` has no
  CLI command yet, so it has no MCP tool yet either.

  `@qa-ai-stlc/core` gains a public `EngineContext` interface (`CommandContext` minus the CLI's own
  `io`/`json` concerns) that both the CLI and the MCP server build their own adapters into.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b218ce9: Add `@qa-ai-stlc/mcp-server`, the local stdio MCP server: `qa-mcp-server` starts it. `ToolDefinition` pairs a Zod input and output schema with a handler that returns a value matching the output schema or throws — a `QaError` for an expected failure, anything else for a bug. `registerTool` turns a thrown error into a structured `CallToolResult` carrying a stable `code` and, when there is one, a `remediation`, never a raw stack trace; invalid tool input is rejected automatically by the registered Zod schema before the handler runs. Ships with one built-in tool, `qa.ping`, a health check. Calls no model itself.
